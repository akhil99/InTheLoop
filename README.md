# InTheLoop
A Chrome extension that improves the School Loop interface by letting users enter a sandbox mode in which they can calculate what their grades would be after the teacher inputs or deletes grades.

##Future Features:   
1. Improved user interface 
2. Add a function that displays total # of points per category and overall
3. More robust grade calculation (function even with letter grades instead of numbers)
4. Work with point-based grading system
5. Add and edit categories
6. Final grade calculation


##Installation
InTheLoop is still in development, but the beta version is available [here](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/in-the-loop-for-school-lo/ppigcngidmooiiafkelbilbojiijffag).
