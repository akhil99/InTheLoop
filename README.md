# InTheLoop
A Chrome extension that improves the School Loop interface by letting users enter a sandbox mode in which they can calculate what their grades would be after the teacher inputs or deletes grades.

##Installation
InTheLoop is still in development, and is not on the Chrome Web Store at the moment. However, if you would like to install the beta version:   

1.  Download the extension.crx file located at "build_final/extension.crx" (click "View Raw")
2.  Go to the chrome://extensions page and enable the "Developer Mode" checkbox
3.  Drag and drop the file into chrome://extensions
4.  Go to the "Progress Report" page for one of your classes.
Note: This extension only works for number grades (not for letter grades like "A")
