# InTheLoop
A Chrome extension that improves the School Loop interface with 2 core features.
1. Allows for adding/deleting grades to calculate one's grade even before it is updated.
2. Adds a theming interface (comes with 1 default theme)

##Installation
InTheLoop is still in development, and is not on the Chrome Web Store at the moment. However, if you would like to install the beta version: 
1.  Download the extension.crx file in build_final/extension.crx (click "View Raw")
2.  Drag and drop the file into chrome://extensions
3.  Go to the "Progress Report" page for one of your classes.
Note: This extension only works for number grades (not for letter grades like "A")
